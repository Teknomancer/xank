Windows build instructions
==========================

1. Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express:
    http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-cpp-express

2. GNU sed:
    http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages.html and install it.

    a. Add the installation path to the Environment variables
      - Right-click COmputer->Properties->Advanced System Settings->Environment Variables
      - Add "C:\program files (x86)\gnuwin32\bin" to "PATH" under "System Variables"

3. GNU readline:
    http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages.html and install it.

	  - xank.sln refers to hardcoded "C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\lib\readline.lib".
	    If you have it installed somewhere else, update xank project properties
		Linker->Input->Additional Dependencies line for "readline.lib"
		(Make sure you change to "All configurations")

4. Rebuilding a new MPIR:
	I already provide pre-build static binaries for Win32. It is in "Libs\Windows\MPIR".
	But if you want to rebuild MPIR (or a later version) here are the steps.

	Download source tarball for MPIR from http://www.mpir.org/ or use the tarball included
	in xank/Libs/.

	a. VS Yasm: (See http://yasm.tortall.net/Download.html)
		- Get http://www.tortall.net/projects/yasm/releases/vsyasm-1.2.0-win32.zip
		- Copy 'vsyasm.exe' to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\bin

	b. Open build.vc10\mpir.sln (VS2011 Solution), ignore errors about "x64" if any.
		- Always build both Debug and Release configurations of the library.
		- Change Active configurations "lib_mpir_p4" and "lib_mpir_cxx" to "Debug"
		  and "Release", for each configuration:
			- Right-click "lib_mpir_p4" -> Rebuild.
			- Right-click "lib_mpir_cxx" -> Rebuild.
		- Copy "build.vc10\lib\Win32\[Debug|Release]\*" to
		  "Libs\Windows\MPIR\[Debug|Release]\*" folders.
		The files should be:
			config.h
			gmp-mparam.h
			gmp.h
			gmpxx.h
			mpir.h
			mpir.lib
			mpir.pdb
			mpirxx.h
			mpirxx.lib
			mpirxx.pdb

5. Open xank.sln and build (or rebuild as the case maybe).
